Before a big commit.
(we need to make the tests!!!)

- Check all notebooks work fine
- Check that requirements has all the necessary libraries. Otherwise readmydocs may not produce the code tab
- run update_doc_elements.sh to update the Shpinx tutorial notebooks
- if you add some math to the notebooks probably you have to go afterwards to the rst and change the latex enviroment
  to ..math:
- Then you can build or not the html to check offline if everything is in order
- Push and check that readmydocs just worked fine
